      <h2>My Newest Accomplishments</h2>
      <h4>The Zoo Problem</h4>
      <p>
        I developed a comprehensive webpage for the Wild Animal Mini-Zoo to
        assist new zookeeper interns in identifying animals and understanding
        their behaviors. The page was structured using major HTML semantic tags,
        ensuring clear organization and readability. Each animal type was
        categorized with headings and detailed descriptions, accompanied by
        photos and external links for further information. The project
        emphasized clean code practices by incorporating detailed comments
        throughout the HTML.
      </p>

      <h4>Grocery List</h4>
      <p>
        I focused on creating a digital grocery list using HTML and CSS to make
        grocery shopping more convenient. I structured the content with semantic
        HTML tags, categorized the items into sections with distinct background
        colors, and styled the headers and main text for visual clarity.
        Additionally, I implemented various CSS techniques to enhance the
        layout, including using the box model for spacing and borders, and
        incorporated both internal and external CSS styles.
      </p>

      <h4>Personal Website Project</h4>
      <p>
        I practiced Agile Development by using a Kanban board to manage the
        creation of a personal website. I set up a project titled Personal
        Website Project, organized tasks into discrete units, and utilized both
        List View and Board View to track progress. This approach ensured a
        structured workflow and clear visibility of the development stages. The
        experience enhanced my skills in task management and Agile
        methodologies, culminating in a well-organized project ready for
        submission.
